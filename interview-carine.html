            <h2>Medium and Materials</h2>

            <p><b>Q) What is your favorite medium?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) I have worked with many mediums, but my favorite is oil on
              glass. It allows me to capture the feeling of strong, strange
              movement that I like to create. My secret is mixing oil paint with
              a lot of grease, it's the best way to keep the paint pliable for
              days.
            </p>

            <p>
              I used to have a studio at home, but I know oil can cause
              headaches and be bad for health, especially when mixed with
              turpentine. That's why I prefer working with grease.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) Is there a specific type of grease you use to mix with
                oil?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) It's just a generic grease. I use half paint and half grease.
              The smell is actually more bearable than oil by itself or oil
              mixed with turpentine.
            </p>

            <h2>Surface and Mindset</h2>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) When I was working on Unleaving, I used so many sheets
                before discovering glass towards the end. What surface do you
                use for painting?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) I like painting on glass. It's strange because you lose it, you
              have to be humble. You can't be proud because in the morning, the
              painting is gone.
            </p>

            <p><b>Q) Does that help you to cultivate a certain mindset?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) I paint in the middle of the night on a lightbox, and I'm the
              only one who sees it. No one else witnesses it in its true form,
              only in the images I capture. I think what people see is only 10%
              of the magic.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Q) Is cultivating humility part of your artistic mindset?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              A) It's unconscious. I can think of it now, but at the time when I
              do it, at night when I see it, I say it's really nice and I enjoy
              it. Then in the morning, it's all gone. It feels like a dream,
              especially when I'm in a state where I need to be able to focus.
              Painting on glass is really difficult; you have to be really
              focused because it's not like pencil and paper where you can redo
              it or change it. Once it's gone, it's gone. Especially for my
              style where everything moves, it's really hard, but in my mind,
              once you get there, it's magical.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              "I work at night. When the sun comes up, I have a coffee, then go
              to bed, and it feels like it was all a dream."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Developing Focus</h2>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) Do you think it takes time to develop the focus and
                alignment needed for that mindset?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) The first frame is always the hardest. It sometimes takes me
              three to four days just to complete the first frame. After that,
              the process becomes easier as I get used to the style, colors, and
              theme. But overcoming that first step takes the most time.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) You mentioned the first frame is the hardest to paint. What
                helps you start that first frame? Do you look for
                inspiration?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) It's more a feeling I'm looking for rather than a reference or
              a book. I want to understand how to make people feel in order to
              capture it. It's not exactly what it is, but rather a feeling.
              What people feel when they look at the frame, that's the
              abstraction of it. Sometimes I read a book; if it doesn't work I
              grab another book, etc. I keep exploring what captures the
              feeling.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) Do you have to be in a certain mood or feeling before you
                paint?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) Yeah, I read a little, then I go to the studio. It's always
              difficult to get into the feeling. If it doesn't work, I go back
              and do it again. I don't have a smooth process. It's always
              difficult. I know it takes time, but when I know what feeling to
              capture, it becomes easier.
            </p>

            <h2>Creative Process: Surrender vs. Control</h2>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) They say the creative process is a process of surrender, not
                control. If you control it, the outcome won't work, but if you
                let it unfold and surrender, then it's magic. What do you think
                of that saying?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) It's true, but you have producers; you have to make promises
              (certain expectations) to yourself and other collaborators when
              you're working on a movie. You have a lot of expectations of
              yourself [pointing very high], but you can meet it in the middle
              [pointing to half of the distance] whenever you're ready. You may
              never reach the top or the highest expectations, but who needs
              perfection?
            </p>

            <p>
              But when you surrender, you realize that's the best place because
              it serves the feelings you want to capture. Meeting half of your
              promises/expectations isn't high, but it will get you there.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) So the mindset is like aiming for perfection but not being
                confined by it?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) Perfection isn't possible. It takes too much time, and in the
              end, it may not capture the feelings. It's not too interesting.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              "Perfection isn't interesting." ~ Carine Khalife
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              Perfection, it can be nice, well done, but how does it feel
              looking at it? It is impressive and may not move you or make you
              feel anything.
            </p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>

            <p><b>Q) Are there certain artists that inspired you?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) Yes, "Hedgehog in the Fog," a film by Yuri Norstein. It's my
              favorite. I don't necessarily understand the film, but it's the
              way it makes me feel, relief, comfort, confusion, etc.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Setup</h2>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) What do you use for light source during painting
                animation?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) I use a lightbox that comes from beneath. The more paint there
              is, the darker it is. Color and darkness are different. I can
              paint bright yellow, but the more I add, it can turn darker. I
              love how you can see the brush strokes through the light.
            </p>

            <p><b>Q) Do you come across reflection during capturing?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) I work in a dark room. I don't use daylight; you have to have a
              constant source of light.
            </p>

            <p><b>Q) How do you capture it?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) I capture through a camera above. When I capture, it doesn't
              flash. It's connected to my computer.
            </p>

            <p><b>Q) What software do you use to capture?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) I use DragonFrame. I can see 50% of the previous frame. It
              gives you the benefit of seeing your art, something to check
              against, like if you have pencil art.
            </p>

            <p>
              You have more control when you have the sequence running. You have
              a sense of painting. Sometimes you can see a nice frame, but maybe
              the movement is off, and that's why you need to see the sequence
              while painting.
            </p>

            <p>
              You must feel the movement and not only have a nice picture. It's
              like a singer singing, they can't stop the voice at some point;
              they need to keep singing and stop when it feels convenient to
              convey a rhythm.
            </p>

            <h2>Planning and Storyboarding</h2>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) Is there planning involved before you start painting
                animation? Or is it a matter of getting into a certain mood?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) You have to plan a little, even if it's just in your mind. You
              have to think about it before you start painting, even if it's
              like "I have a few seconds [making a sound 'foosh'] then
              acceleration." You have to think about it, feel it before doing
              it. Painting is difficult, and you have little control. What helps
              is always seeing the previous frame, capturing the feeling you
              want to convey as a way of having some control over the animation.
              Thinking about it before painting it helps a lot.
            </p>

            <p>I like to let things go.</p>

            <p><b>Q) What do you use for storyboarding?</b></p>

            <p>
              A) I don't really draw much before I start painting animation,
              except if I have a strong feeling to make a certain image. I
              usually clean a wall, use Post-it notes with notes like "picking
              up a wave," "small wave," "big wave," "skies," etc. Then I have my
              whole timeline.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b
                >Q) I know some artists do storyboarding in detail, but for you,
                is it like a destination?</b
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              A) If I put expectations too high and if I don't get there, then I
              feel disappointed by not meeting them. I've learned that I don't
              have to control everything. I only control what I want people to
              feel. Like, I control if it's going to be dark, strong, small, or
              whatever. Then I make some sketches. It's not like I don't sketch
              at all. I don't feel like I have to do more than that. I think
              about it before the animation, and then I let it go. It works!
