              <h1>Interview with Patrick Jenkins: Paint-on-Glass Animation</h1>

              <h2>About Patrick Jenkins</h2>

              <p>Patrick Jenkins is a multi-media artist who makes graphic novels and paint-on-glass animated films. His first graphic novel "Tales from Phantom City" was published in 2023. His recent stop motion animated film, "Hall of Mirrors" (2023), is currently showing on CBC Television and at CBC Gem online. Recently he completed his second graphic novel.</p>

              <p>You can view his work on <a href="https://vimeo.com/user12605489" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>.</p>

              <h2>Medium and Materials</h2>

              <p><b>Q) What medium do you use for painting animation?</b></p>

              <p>A) I use gouache mixed with glycerin and water. I didn't want to use traditional oil because of the thinner—my buddy did this years ago and he almost burned up his sense of smell from being that close to oil paint all the time.</p>

              <p>The glycerin prevents the gouache paint from drying. I don't have a specific ratio of gouache to glycerin. I do it more by feel. For instance, if the mixture is too runny, I add more gouache. If it's drying, I add more glycerin, etc.</p>

              <p><b>Q) Do you work on glass?</b></p>

              <p>A) Yes, paint on glass. With paint on glass, you have to repaint the character every time. There's no real cheats. You don't get to reuse cutouts—you have to redo each thing. It's almost like classical animation, like Disney and the old drawn stuff, except you do it without paper. You can see the previous drawing, but you're just painting. You just hope you have it right.</p>

              <p>But don't forget, you can also take a shot and then look at it on the screen and go between the old and the new. And you can eliminate ones that you don't like. What I'm trying to say is you have to get it right before you move on to the next one. Sometimes I would tweak it a bit, depending on what it looked like on the screen.</p>

              <h2>The Black Box Setup</h2>

              <p><b>Q) Can you explain your black box setup?</b></p>

              <p>A) The reason for the black box was just so I didn't have to be in the dark, but I just closed the door when I took the shot. The black box has a grid wall and metal frame. The walls are made of foam core. I only close the door when I'm capturing the shot. I open it to remove the artwork surface to repaint the image between shots.</p>

              <p><b>Q) How does the registration system work?</b></p>

              <p>A) The artwork is done on a white or black board with peg holes on the back. When I want to take a shot of the artwork, I place it on registration pegs on the animation stand so everything lines up and it is always in the same place when the artwork is photographed.</p>

              <h2>Camera and Lens</h2>

              <p><b>Q) What camera setup do you use?</b></p>

              <p>A) I use a 50mm prime camera lens. That keeps the image sharp and flat with no distortion around the edges. I wouldn't use a zoom lens for this kind of filming.</p>

              <p><b>Q) What was the issue with digital camera aperture?</b></p>

              <p>A) When I started doing this, I bought a camera with a lens—great, I thought I'm all set up. Put it on manual, set all my F-stop and my shutter speed. I took some shots, and I played them back, and they were flickering. I thought, "Well, what's that?" This just drives you nuts.</p>

              <p>With digital SLRs, it shows you the brightest image even when you're in manual, and the camera is actually controlling the F-stop. So what happens when you take the shot? It zips down to say 5.6, but it doesn't hit it perfectly each time. It hits it really close, but for animation purposes, it's wavering. It's too slight, too small, and then you play it back—it drives you nuts.</p>

              <p>So what I ended up having to do was get an adapter and buy an old manual lens and stick it on this camera so that I could override that. The old manual lens completely locks the F-stop mechanically. These are the things—the devil is in the details.</p>

              <h2>Lighting Setup</h2>

              <p><b>Q) What lighting do you use?</b></p>

              <p>A) I use two tungsten bulbs in my setup, positioned at 45-degree angles to the artwork. Both tungsten or LED lights can be used. I did my last film with tungsten, the same as all my films.</p>

              <p><b>Q) Did you try LED lights?</b></p>

              <p>A) I bought LEDs because it gets very hot, especially in the summer, with just those two little tungsten light bulbs. It can warm up the place quickly. So I thought it would be nice to have a cool light instead of a hot light. I was starting a new project and felt the LEDs were washing out the blacks a bit, so I stayed with what I had used, which was tungsten.</p>

              <p>LED lights should work fine. Maybe in a future project I'll use them.</p>

              <p><b>Q) What about electricity fluctuations?</b></p>

              <p>A) Power fluctuations are possible. There's the electricity that comes into the house—it's always changing. It's not changing wildly until, for instance, you get the summer when it's hot and everybody throws their air conditioners on. It actually starts dropping, and air conditioners are very tough on keeping the lights consistent.</p>

              <p>I use a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) to solve this.</p>

              <h2>Color and White Balance</h2>

              <p><b>Q) What's your approach to color?</b></p>

              <p>A) I restrict myself to 3 colors, as each color has to be repainted each shot. It keeps it simpler for me. It's a personal choice. The less color you use in animation, the better results you can get. When you have too many colors at the same time, it's difficult.</p>

              <p>I did one film that had more color in it and it was just crazy. It was hard to keep track of them all. It just adds to the complexity.</p>

              <p><b>Q) Do different colors behave differently with glycerin?</b></p>

              <p>A) Yes, it may be that glycerin interacts chemically to cause fluctuations in certain colors. I have no scientific explanation for this, but it was something I encountered. For instance, burnt sienna or something—it would start having its own mind, interacting between the composition of the color.</p>

              <p><b>Q) How do you handle white balance?</b></p>

              <p>A) You can deal with that in the camera. You do a white balance—you put a white piece of paper, take a shot, and you set the camera so that's the white. I do that at the beginning of the filmmaking process. Once the white balance is set, I use it through the whole filmmaking process.</p>

              <h2>Animation Philosophy</h2>

              <p><b>Q) What's your approach to keeping things manageable?</b></p>

              <p>A) Well, I keep it simple because that's the look I want in my films. I pare down the imagery to what is essential to depict the shot. Also, it allows me to work faster as the imagery is not as detailed. The more detail you have, the more work it will be.</p>

              <p>Each artist has their own scope. You talk about Petrov—I couldn't do that. Just forget about it. It's too much for me. I have to keep things much simpler.</p>

              <p>In animation, you have to decide on your own parameters, what are comfortable for you. I would always try to just keep it to what needs to be in the shot. What is the shot conveying? Just keep it to that without piling on too many details.</p>

              <p><b>Q) Any final tips you'd give to someone starting with paint-on-glass animation?</b></p>

              <p>A) Keep it simple. Ha.</p>
