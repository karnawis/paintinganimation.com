              <h1>Interview with Patrick Jenkins: Painting Animation Process and Setup</h1>

              <h2>Medium and Materials</h2>

              <p class="question">Q) What medium do you use for painting animation?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) I use gouache mixed with glycerin and water. I didn't want to use traditional oil because of the thinner—my buddy did this years ago and he almost burned up his sense of smell from being that close to oil paint all the time. So I use gouache, and then I mix gouache, glycerin, and water. It's very intuitive. I can't even tell you the exact ratio because sometimes I put some water and glycerin—no, too much glycerin. Okay, more paint. You know, until I got it right.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">The glycerin makes it so the paint never dries. There's no way it can dry, but it's still like mud, like sticky mud. So it never actually gets hard. That's traditionally how people have done paint on glass.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) What's the ratio of gouache to glycerin that you typically use?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) I don't have a specific ratio of gouache to glycerin. I do it more by feel. For instance, if the mixture is too runny, I add more gouache. If it's drying, I add more glycerin, etc. The dictionary spells it as glycerin, and it prevents the gouache paint from drying.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Do you work on glass?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Yes, paint on glass. With paint on glass, you have to repaint the character every time. There's no real cheats. You don't get to reuse cutouts—you have to redo each thing. It's almost like classical animation, like Disney and the old drawn stuff, except you do it without paper. You can see the previous drawing, but you're just painting. You just hope you have it right.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">But don't forget, you can also take a shot and then look at it on the screen and go between the old and the new. And you can eliminate ones that you don't like. What I'm trying to say is you have to get it right before you move on to the next one. Sometimes I would tweak it a bit, depending on what it looked like on the screen.</p>

              <h2>The Black Box Setup</h2>

              <p class="question">Q) Can you explain your black box setup?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) The reason for the black box was just so I didn't have to be in the dark, but I just closed the door when I took the shot. So I close the door when I take the picture. It's just made out of foam core—you can see what it's made out of. You put the camera elevated a bit, and then you zoom in, usually 50% so the field doesn't get the distortion at the edges.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">So it's a good idea to zoom in 50% and make sure it goes through the hole. I would take the painting out, put it in, scan, and then take it back out to paint.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) What materials did you use to build your black box?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) The black box has a grid wall and metal frame. The walls are made of foam core. I only close the door when I'm capturing the shot. I open it to remove the artwork surface to repaint the image between shots.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Do you paint with the glass outside the black box, then place it inside just for capturing digitally?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Yes, the artwork is done on a white or black board with peg holes on the back. When I want to take a shot of the artwork, I place it on registration pegs on the animation stand so everything lines up and it is always in the same place when the artwork is photographed.</p>

              <h2>Lighting Challenges</h2>

              <p class="question">Q) What lighting issues did you encounter?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) There are two problems with lighting. First, there's the electricity that comes into the house—it's always changing. It's not changing wildly until, for instance, you get the summer when it's hot and everybody throws their air conditioners on. It actually starts dropping, and air conditioners are very tough on keeping the lights consistent.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">So you get there and you say, "Wait a minute, I've got flicker. These are different intensities." That's why I bring it up—just to be aware.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) What about the camera itself?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) The second thing is the digital SLR camera. When I started doing this, I bought a camera with a lens—great, I thought I'm all set up. Put it on manual, set all my F-stop and my shutter speed. I took some shots, and I played them back, and they were flickering. I thought, "Well, what's that?" This just drives you nuts.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">In the old type of film cameras, SLR (single lens reflex), when you set your F-stop, it was on the lens and it was locked in. There was nothing that could change that except you turning that ring. With the digital SLRs, it shows you the brightest image even when you're in manual, and the camera is actually controlling the F-stop.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">So what happens when you take the shot? It zips down to say 5.6, but it doesn't hit it perfectly each time. It hits it really close, but for animation purposes, it's wavering. It's too slight, too small, and then you play it back—it drives you nuts.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">So what I ended up having to do was get an adapter and buy an old manual lens and stick it on this camera so that I could override that. These are the things—the devil is in the details.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Why did you need to use an old manual lens with an adapter?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Yes, digital cameras automatically adjust the aperture even in manual mode. The old manual lens completely locks the F-stop mechanically, which is essential for consistent animation frames.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) What about LED lights versus incandescent?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) I bought LEDs because it gets very hot, especially in the summer, with just those two little tungsten light bulbs. It can warm up the place quickly. So I thought it would be nice to have a cool light instead of a hot light. But what I was doing to the paintings, I didn't like. I was going to have to fuss to get the contrast back. It was sort of flattening the colors. So I stayed with tungsten.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) What made you decide between LED and tungsten lighting?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Both tungsten or LED lights can be used. I did my last film with tungsten, the same as all my films. LED lights should work fine. Maybe in a future project I'll use them. That's right, I use two tungsten bulbs in my setup, positioned at 45-degree angles to the artwork.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) How did you solve the electricity fluctuation problem?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Yes, power fluctuations are possible. Yes, I use a UPS.</p>

              <h2>Color Palette and Workflow</h2>

              <p class="question">Q) What's your approach to color?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) I would definitely limit your color. The less color you use in animation, the better results you can get. When you have too many colors at the same time, it's difficult. I almost always minimize to three colors max, because otherwise it'll be just crazy. It always turns muddy when they mix—too much going on. It's hard to track if you start piling in the colors.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">I did one film that had more color in it and it was just crazy. It was hard to keep track of them all. It just adds to the complexity.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Why do you limit yourself to 3 colors?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) I restrict myself to 3 colors, as each color has to be repainted each shot. It keeps it simpler for me. It's a personal choice.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Any other color tips?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Another thing—even blacks are different. They've got ivory black, charcoal black—they're all different. They're not the same. They try to say, "Oh no, we don't have that, but this will do," and you get it under the camera and it's a different color. Some of them are more brownish.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">Also, if I start something, I have to have a lot of paint because otherwise it'll be very difficult to match. Certain colors can be discontinued. I was using a color and ran out of it, went to the shop, and they'd discontinued it in Canada. I ended up having to order it from Edmonton—they had a couple of tubes left.</p>

              <h2>Technical Process</h2>

              <p class="question">Q) How do you handle color temperature and white balance?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) You can deal with that in the camera. You do a white balance—you put a white piece of paper, take a shot, and you set the camera so that's the white. You really get that out of the way right away.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) How often do you need to set white balance?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) I do that at the beginning of the filmmaking process. Once the white balance is set, I use it through the whole filmmaking process.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) You mentioned certain colors behaving differently. Can you give an example?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) With gouache and glycerin, certain colors were a nightmare. Like burnt sienna or something—it would start having its own mind, interacting between the composition of the color. Whatever makes up burnt sienna was interacting with the glycerin. So I would have to do cheats sometimes, like freeze frame that one frame and then do some masking.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Have you encountered colors that behave differently with glycerin?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Yes, it may be that glycerin interacts chemically to cause fluctuations in certain colors. I have no scientific explanation for this, but it was something I encountered.</p>

              <h2>Animation Philosophy</h2>

              <p class="question">Q) What's your approach to keeping things manageable?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) You want to just not get too complicated where you can barely do anything without it taking a lot of work. Each artist has their own scope. You talk about Petrov—I couldn't do that. Just forget about it. It's too much for me. I have to keep things much simpler.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">It's more Zen what I do. I'm even doing this with my graphic novels—how few lines can you make a person out of? And then the audience kind of fills in the rest of it. Whereas that's like maximalist, trying to do everything—the grass blowing, the person breathing in some cases.</p>
              
              <p class="answer">In animation, you have to decide on your own parameters, what are comfortable for you. I would always try to just keep it to what needs to be in the shot. What is the shot conveying? Just keep it to that without piling on too many details.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) What's your philosophy on how much detail to include?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Well, I keep it simple because that's the look I want in my films. I pare down the imagery to what is essential to depict the shot. Also, it allows me to work faster as the imagery is not as detailed. The more detail you have, the more work it will be.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Advice for testing?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) When you're starting like a little test, just start with two colors. Because it's just a test. You're just trying to see how it goes, and then take it from there.</p>

              <p class="question">Q) Any final tips you'd give to someone starting with paint-on-glass animation?</p>
              <p class="answer">A) Keep it simple. Ha.</p>
